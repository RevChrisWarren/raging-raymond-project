# Raging Raymond Project

## Description

Raging Raymond is a fundraiser to help raise funds for a medical condition called VAMP2. All donations go to Nemour's Hospital for research and to help with the fishing tournament that also raises money to support the research. With this website you can read about the family and VAMP2. You can register for the fish tournament and see a gallery of photos from the tournament. You can also sign-up and login and discuss fishing or VAMP2. There is also a payment gateway that allows you to donate to the cause.
